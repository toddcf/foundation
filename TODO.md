# To Do

- Add displays to the UI so the console can be closed. (Then delete the console logs.)
  - Display list of included exercises every time createWorkout() fires.
- Chain the workout timers to each other.
- Build basic UI in BEM, following proper accessibility protocols. (Functionality only, style later.)
  - Pause button
  - Reset / Cancel button
  - Intervals
- Add event listeners to JS so that user selections trigger things in the JS.
- Find sfx and add them to the project:
  - Start workout.
  - Last 5 seconds of pose. (One beep per second except for zero.)
  - Finish pose || exercise || circuit || workout.
