# To Do

- Pause / Resume button
  - Reconfigure `beginNextExercise()` to `setCountdownTimer()`, and reconfigure `countdownTimer()` to `runCountdownTimer()`. Move incrementations, resets, etc. into `runCountdownTimer()`.
    - Figure out the "If circuit is finished" scenario.
- BUG: Make sure certain buttons can't be clicked while the timer is already running.  (Will fire multiple timers and confuse the UI.)
- Circuits input: Make sure everything still updates when up and down arrows are clicked. That functionality was lost when the `keyup` condition was added.
- Reset / Cancel button
- Display the name of the current exercise in the UI.
- Style UI.
  - Adobe XD.
  - Use proper accessibility protocols.
  - Refactor in BEM.
- Convert `setCircuits` function to regex for numerical keyups.
- Find sfx and add them to the project:
  - Start workout.
  - Last 5 seconds of pose. (One beep per second except for zero.)
  - Finish pose || exercise || circuit || workout.
  - User option to turn sound on or off.
- Do I need to disable the rest of the buttons while a workout is in progress? Otherwise, what happens if the user selects a new workout while the timer is runnig?
- What should the "Begin Workout" button do after the workout has ended? Right now it just prints "Finished!" to the console again. It doesn't reset anything.
  - Maybe every time `createWorkout()` fires, it should save all the starting settings. That way at the end, a function can be invoked that goes back to those settings, even though the timer doesn't begin again unless you click the "Begin Workout" button.
- A bar at the bottom that visually shows the percentage of your workout that's done. Increments every second.
