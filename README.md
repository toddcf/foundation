# Foundation Workout Timer

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. As a coder, I do a lot of sitting. It is important to counteract this with exercise. The book "Foundation" by Dr. Eric Goodman and Peter Park outlines a series of yoga exercises and stretches that target the back. I have found the program extremely beneficial, but have wished I had a timer that could help me keep track of when to move on to the next pose.
2. As a coder, I am always looking for ways to practice and expand my skill set. So why not architect and build myself a Foundation countdown timer with JavaScript? (And once I've got the functionality down, why not use my UI/UX skills to make it sleek and user-friendly?)


## Functionality

- User selects difficulty of workout from a dropdown. Program is created and a time estimate is generated.
  - Basic (five main exercises).
  - Moderate (Basic, plus two more exercises).
  - Intense (Basic, Moderate, plus more.)
- User selects or deselects "Bonus" checkbox. Program is recreated each time, along with a time estimate.
- User types in number of circuits (min 1). Workout time estimate is revised on keyup.
